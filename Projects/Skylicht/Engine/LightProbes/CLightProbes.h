	/// @brief Light probes are objects that store SH illumination. These SH values are baked from environmental texture maps, such as a skybox or skydome.
	/// @ingroup IndirectLighting
	/// 
	/// You can use Lightmapper::CLightmapper to bake light into CLightProbes, 
	/// or you can also bake it directly from Skylicht-Editor once you have set up the Sky environment.
	/// 
	/// @image html Lighting/light_probes_0.jpg "The ambient light that shines on objects is influenced by light probes and the environment" width=1200px
	/// 
	/// The baking process recalculates the colors and stores them in CLightProbeData.
	/// This value is then mapped to the nearest objects with CIndirectLightingData.
	/// This SH value will eventually be passed to the Shader during the drawing step.
